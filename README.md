#Step 1: Using a Code Snippet Plugin

To safely add custom code to your WordPress site without editing theme files directly, I recommend using a code snippet plugin. Plugins like “Code Snippets” allow you to add, activate, deactivate, or delete code snippets easily. This approach is safer and more manageable than modifying header.php or functions.php files, which can cause site errors if done incorrectly.

After installing and activating the Code Snippets plugin, you can add new PHP code that runs across your website.

#Step 2: Adding the Partial Checkout Capture Code

I created a custom snippet titled WooCommerce Partial Checkout Data Capture with Optimized AJAX Handling. This snippet captures the customer’s name, phone number, address, IP address, and the products added to the cart. The code uses AJAX to send this data to the backend as soon as the checkout form is filled out, before the order is placed.

The beauty of this method is that it works on any WooCommerce site and has been tested on multiple client websites, including some operating internationally (such as in Kuwait). It runs seamlessly on both the frontend and backend, ensuring you get real-time data capture.

I will provide the full code snippet in the description below for you to copy and paste into your WordPress site’s code snippet manager.

#Step 3: Activating and Running the Snippet

Once you paste the code into a new snippet, save it and activate it. Make sure to configure the snippet to run everywhere on your site—both frontend and backend—so that it captures data regardless of where the visitor is or what page they are on.
